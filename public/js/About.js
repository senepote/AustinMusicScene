        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>When considering what to do for this project I had several ideas.... some good, some ok... some boring. I'm a huge music fan and Austin has a giant music scene here. I go to a good 2 to 4 shows a month, more if possible or if there's too many good ones to miss out on.</p>
        </br>
        <p>I decided on trying to combine React into the MEAN stack and remove Angular. React is... sometimes fun, sometimes difficult (especially when it comes to the CSS).</p>
        </br>
        <p>The end product of this didn't come out the way I had envisioned. I'm happy with the styling and layout, but for setup I definitely hit a creative wall many, many times.</p>
